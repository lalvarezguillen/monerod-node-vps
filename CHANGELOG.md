## v0.2.3

- Allow running and maintaining nodes on Vultr

## v0.2.2

- Allow running and maintaining nodes on preexisting infrastructure. This
would bypass all the server-creation logic, and go straight to configuring
the preexisting server.

## v0.2.1

- Allow running and maintaining nodes on DigitalOcean as well. The only caveat is
that volumes can't be resized on DigitalOcean at this point in time.

## v0.2.0

- Switched to using yaml for hosts file
- Allow running several Monero public nodes on Hetzner, with different configurations

## v0.1.0

- Initial setup
- Allows running and maintaining a single Monero public node on Hetzner
