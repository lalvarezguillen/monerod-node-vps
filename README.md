### Creates a public monero node on a VPS

The purpose of this project is to simplify the creation and maintenance
of **public** Monero nodes on virtual private servers. Where maintenance
involves the following tasks:

* Upgrading monero version.
* Enabling, disabling and updating flags passed to `monerod`.
* Extending disk space allocated to store the blockchain.

The project aims to:

* Be as simple as possible.
* Produce a node that seeds the blockchain (public node).
* Produce a secure and stable setup.
* Produce an inexpensive setup by default.
* Make maintenance as easy as posible.
* Allow creating mainnet, stagenet or testnet nodes.

The project doesn't intend to produce a setup optimized for mining.

### Requirements

* Python
* Ansible
* Ansible's `hcloud` colletion: https://galaxy.ansible.com/hetzner/hcloud
* Ansible's `community.general` collection: https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general

You also need the appropriate API Keys for the VPS provider (Hetzner only,
for the time being), and public SSH key to setup in the server.

### Long term goals

* Extend to be able to setup nodes in other VPS providers, besides Hetzner
* Extend to be able to create/maintain several nodes, across different
clouds, with different configurations.
* Maybe include automated CI setup.

### Usage

1. Set up the following environment variables

    * `HETZNER_API_KEY`
    * `PUBLIC_SSH_KEY_NAME`
    * `PUBLIC_SSH_KEY`

2. Run `ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-monero.yml`

That should create a public Monero mainnet node, running on the smallest Hetzner
VPS, with a 50GB volume attached, and keeping a pruned blockchain. It'd expose
port 22 for ssh, port 18080 for p2p, and port 18089 for restricted RPC.

The estimated cost of this setup is 3.01â‚¬/month, according to my Hetzner dashboard.

Further configuration can be achieved via other environment variables. They're
listed below

### Environment variables reference

* `HETZNER_API_KEY`: Your API key for Hetzner. It's required. It should be an
API key with read and write permissions.

* `PUBLIC_SSH_KEY_NAME`: A name for your public SSH key in Hetzner

* `PUBLIC_SSH_KEY`: Your public SSH key. It'd be created in Hetzner and
embedded in your node; to be able to set up the node, and access it
in general.

* `NETWORK_FLAG`:
    
    * Empty by default, which indicates mainnet
    * `--stagenet`
    * `--testnet`

* `HETZNER_REGION`: The Hetzner datacenter where the node should be created.
Defaults to `fsn1`. See [this](https://docs.hetzner.com/general/others/data-centers-and-connection/) for context

* `HETZNER_SERVER_TYPE`: The type of Hetzner server to create for the node.
Defaults to `cx11`, which is the smallest available. See Prices Section
[here](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)

* `HETZNER_IMAGE`: The Hetzner machine image to use on the server. Defaults
to `ubuntu-20.04`.

* `HETZNER_VOLUME_GB_SIZE`: The size of he volume that will hold the blochain,
expressed in gb. Defaults to `50`

* `MONERO_DESIRED_VERSION`: The version of Monero that the node should be running.
Defaults to `v0.17.1.9` at the moment.

* `MONERO_DOWNLOAD_URL`: The URL where Monero should be downloaded from. Defaults
to `https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64`

* `MONERO_DOWNLOAD_CHECKSUM`: The checksum of the Monero download, to verify
its integrity. Defaults to the checksum of Monero v0.17.1.9 at the moment:
`sha256:0fb6f53b7b9b3b205151c652b6c9ca7e735f80bfe78427d1061f042723ee6381`

* `PRUNED_NODE`: Whether the node should run a pruned blockchain, to
save disk space. Defaults to `True`

* `ENABLE_DNS_BLOCKLIST`: Whether the node should run with `--enabled-dns-blocklist`.
Defaults to `True`. See [this](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/7139)
for context

* `LIMIT_RATE_UP` and `LIMIT_RATE_DOWN`: Limit the upload speed available to the Monero node. Defaults to empty, which means that the default limits configured
by Monero apply.

* `OUT_PEERS` and `IN_PEERS`: Limit the number of p2p connections. Defaults
to empty, which applies the default limits configured by Monero.

* `MEMORY_MAX`: Prevents the node from using more than this amount of RAM.
Otherwise it gets restarted. Defaults to `1536M`. See `systemd`'s docs for
[context](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/systemd/systemd.resource-control.5.en.html)

* `MONERO_BAN_LIST_URL`: If provided, downloads a list of IPs of Monero nodes
to ban. Defaults to empty.

### Upgrading Monero Version

The envvar `MONERO_DESIRED_VERSION` governs the version of Monero we want
installed on the node. If the version doesn't match, this project downloads
Monero again from `MONERO_DOWNLOAD_URL`. So, the process of upgrading your
node to the latest version would look like:

1. Set `MONERO_DESIRED_VERSION` to the latest version
2. Set `MONERO_DOWNLOAD_CHECKSUM` to the checksum of the version you're
downloading. This is provided on [Monero's website](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/)
3. Run this project

### Extending the volume allocated to store the blockchain

Simply increasing `HETZNER_VOLUME_GB_SIZE` should take care of extending
the volume and the filesystem.

### Allocating more network resources

[This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ko51jj/running_a_public_node_data_transfer_rate_limits/) suggests that increasing
`OUT_PEERS`, `IN_PEERS`, `LIMIT_RATE_UP`, `LIMIT_RATE_DOWN` would increase
the node's contribution to the network, by connecting to more peers, accepting
concurrent connections from more peers, and allocating more up/down bandwith
to the node.

The setup suggested in that thread can be achived with:

* `OUT_PEERS=512`
* `IN_PEERS=512`
* `LIMIT_RATE_UP=92160`
* `LIMIT_RATE_DOWN=92160`

The extra traffic might generate additional costs though. Check Pricing section of https://www.hetzner.com/cloud
